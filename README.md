Color Connect is a game that is all about connecting the dots! Colored dots, that is. The player is provided a grid that contains several different colors scattered within it (2 dots of each color). The goal is to draw a line connecting dots of the same color. The player must make sure to adhere to the following rules:

- [ ] No lines may overlap
- [ ] Every space in the grid must be filled (either by a colored dot or a segment of a line)

## Features & Implementation

### Single-Page App

inDecks is a simple and intuitive, single-page application. All content is delivered on the frontend, with the root page listening to user input and rendering a React component dynamically. The use of the React Router gives the user a feeling of navigation, as if they are in control of the app when the url changes. The Redux architecture in conjuction with React allows inDecks to operate via a smooth cycle, allowing rails to simply be an API, serving JSON back to the frontend.`

### Flashcard Studying



### Deck CRUD



## Future Directions for the Project

### Subjects

Another way to enhance the study experience for the user and allow them to further organize their thoughts and information will be to create a Subjects layer, with Decks nested within. For example, a 'Biology' subject may contain decks 'Anatomy', 'Zoology', and 'Microbiology'.

### Search

To create a richer community of students on inDecks, Search would be a major factor. Students will 'own' their own, private decks while being able to search amongst public decks created by other users and add them to their library.
